WitherFour is a startup service built upon the FourSquare API. We aim to function as a location recommendation engine for FourSquare users looking to find new places to go just outside their "comfort zone". We plan to use the FourSquare API through Python and MongoDB, with a Google Maps display as part of the frontend. We hope to begin initial testing on Vlexo to make sure our implementation works on a basic Python installation. As soon as we get set up and running, we plan on moving out so as not to be a large load on the shared server.
